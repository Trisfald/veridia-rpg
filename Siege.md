# Siege engines

All siege engines need to be manned by a minimum number of people. Putting a larger crew to work can speed up the rate of fire or lessen the time needed to breach a fortification.

At least one crew member must have a sufficient level of *machinery* skill in order to operate the weapon effectively.
