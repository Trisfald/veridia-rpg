# <a name="S-summons"></a>Appendix B: Summons

Summoned creatures or objects are faithful replicas of their original pieces. They, however, lack any will of their own, following blindly master's orders to the best of their ability.

Imagination is the key behind the most bizarre summonings. Some creations are unique, void of any resemblance with reality. Nevertheless, it is not possible to achieve something that goes against the laws of nature.
