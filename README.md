# <a name="main"></a>Veridia Tabletop RPG

Veridia is the name of an imaginary world. All began in the mid 2010s when a little indie videogame was made: [Veridia Tactics](https://trisfald.itch.io/veridia-tactics). Being inspired by great tactical titles of the past, the game has a heavy focus on strategy and planning. Nonetheless, great care had been put into the world building process; a part of its potentialities as a fantasy setting were already perceivable, yet at that time much work had still to be done.

The next step saw a change in the medium, going from a videogame to a book. The opera, titled *Veridia*, is a setting manual describing a much more refined world. It could very well be considered as the full expression of the ideas previously pioneered by Veridia Tactics. A free copy is available [here](https://github.com/Trisfald/veridia-book) or as a [free epub](https://books2read.com/b/mY1OaV?edit=maybe-later&store=null). However, it's by no means the finishing line: countless details and stories awaits to be created.

The Veridia Tabletop RPG is born to give people the possibility to leverage Veridia's lore in order to create and experience their own adventures. Reading the setting manual or having played the videogame is not strictly required to start an adventure, but it'll greatly enhance the campaign, so give it a try! 

## Characteristics:
- ### Detailed fantasy setting (late medieval, low to mid magic)
    Veridia is a world resembling our own during the Middle Ages.\
    Magic is neither common nor too rare: it doesn't impact the ordinary life of common people, but it definitely influences the balance of power.\
    Veridia is composed of many regions, each one having its own peculiarities. There are powerful city states, large kingdoms, unexplored lands and more.
- ### One roll per character's turn is enough
    A character never has to roll the dice more than once per turn. This speeds up play considerably. 
- ### Combat can be deadly
    Even if your character is an experienced figher any battle can be dangerous!\
    By using a fixed amount of health points, there's always the risk to receive a long lasting injury from a small foe's lucky hit.
- ### Classless, leveless system
    Characters progress by freely acquiring traits and increasing their abilities and skills. They are not constrained to a certain class or archetype.
- ### Balanced focus on combat and social interactions
    There's an equal amount of attributes and skills for both combat situations and social interactions. Your character can progress either as a fighter or as a pacifist.
